0.020 - 2012-08-03

0.018 - 2012-07-15
  - Allow dots in parameter names
  - Support for basic authentication in test requests

0.017 - 2012-07-05
  - Don't falsely recognize mod_cgid as FCGI

0.016 - 2012-05-11
  - Actually import weaken so the 0.015 fix doesn't implode

0.015 - 2012-05-10
  - Fix a per-application-instance memory leak

0.014 - 2012-04-27
  - Add named path matching
  - Allow headers on CLI calls

0.013 - 2012-04-03
  - Fix a weird interaction between match-spec parsing and module loading
    that was causing brokenness and test failures with perl 5.8.8

0.012 - 2012-01-30
  - Added match predicates match_true and match_false
  - Added '~' to match an empty path
  - Sub-dispatch via '...' is now permissible without a trailing slash
  - Only word char sequences with singular periods are parsed as path parts now
  - Various doc fixes
  - All query body parameters are now decoded from UTF8
  - Allow dots in path matches, so you can have sub (/foo.html)

0.011 - 2011-12-23
  - Add Web::Dispatch::HTTPMethods
  - Fix [ sub {} ] for async code
  - Support match_foo(...) => sub {} as a dispatcher return

0.010 - 2011-10-06
  - Provide $app->run_test_request for use in test scripts
  - Preserve original env in Web::Dispatch so ParamParser can cache in there
    (stops HTTP::Body object getting destroyed early thereby losing uploads)

0.009 - 2011-10-03
  - Complete port from HTTP::Request::AsCGI to Plack::Test
  - Add experimental upload support
  - Update Plack usage to call ::Handler:: classes not ::Server::
  - Assume FastCGI mode if STDIN is a socket (works some places env vars fail)
  - Change CLI mode to print status line and headers to STDERR and content
    to STDOUT so that './myapp /foo.html >foo.html' works sanely
  - Add *.* and **.* dispatch types to keep extension
  - Add Antiquated Perl slides in a POD document.

    but Content-type: blah; charset: blah shits flames)
  - Make Web::Dispatch return [\$cv] as \$cv to allow subref responses
  - Stop undef errors killing XML::Tags conversion to string
  - Fixup dispatcher logic so dispatchers within a /foo/... work correctly
